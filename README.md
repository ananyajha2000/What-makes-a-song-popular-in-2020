Abstract

Measures like lockdown and quarantine to combat COVID 19 might have led to an influx in the consumption
of music and have consequently influenced popularity trends. This study aims to analyse and demonstrate
which features of songs (if any) contribute to their popularity based on the current music listening trends.
Stastical methods like Logistic Regression and Data Visualisation have been implemented to examine the
similarity of these trends during The Great Recession of 2008 and the Pandemic in 2020. This analysis
investigates whether the global environment has an impact on the music listening trends among the public.
The results show substantial similarity between the listening trends and peopleâ€™s preferences of music in the
two periods and testify the hypothesis that music preferences are, in fact, impacted significantly in times of
crisis.
